# Flashcards

This is a flashcard application made with React. There are two views (each of which is a class component): Editor view, where you can manually add new cards to the game, and Viewer view, where you can view cards one by one, or switch to a new card.

This projects uses concepts like `this.props` and `this.state` to alter the page according to user input.
